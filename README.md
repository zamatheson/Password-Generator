# Password-Generator

# Introduction
This is a password generator created with the intent of allowing users to generate a randomized password for their needs. When clicking on the "generate password" button, the user will be given a series of prompts to answer that will customize their password to their liking, allowing for the choice to include certain characters within the generation or not. When the user answers the series of prompts, messages relating to the users actions will appear in the console. After all prompts are answered, a completely random password will appear in the output box.
